## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```


## Compare all models that predict LENGTH other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better. 

## make a simple regression model for age

```{r}
AGEModel <- lm(LENGTH~AGE,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~AGE,data=bears)
abline(AGEModel)
summary.lm(AGEModel)
```


## make a simple regression model for Head Length

```{r}
HeadLengthModel <- lm(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
abline(HeadLengthModel)
summary.lm(HeadLengthModel)
```

## make a simple regression model for Head Width

```{r}
HeadWidthModel <- lm(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
abline(HeadWidthModel)
summary.lm(HeadWidthModel)
```

## make a simple regression model for Chest

```{r}
ChestModel <- lm(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
abline(ChestModel)
summary.lm(ChestModel)
```

## make a simple regression model for Weight

```{r}
WeightModel <- lm(LENGTH~WEIGHT,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~WEIGHT,data=bears)
abline(WeightModel)
summary.lm(WeightModel)
```

The largest adjusted R squared value is 0.8434, which is found with The Head Length model.
